Vision is a prototype of a smart student attendance monitoring and analytics system designed for colleges.
It focuses on fast, reliable, and transparent attendance tracking while reducing manual work for faculty and providing actionable insights for administrators.

This demo showcases the frontend dashboards for all roles â€” Students, Faculty, Admin, and Kiosk â€” using mock data.
The goal is to present how the analytics and workflows will look and function, even without backend integration.

ðŸŽ¯ What this Demo Shows

Student Dashboard â†’ Todayâ€™s status, subject-wise % charts, weekly/monthly trends, and recovery tips.

Faculty View â†’ Class session screen with live counters, pending students, and quick actions.

Admin Panel â†’ Institute-wide KPIs, dept-wise analytics, defaulter distribution, and headcount mode.

Kiosk Device â†’ Session start screen, live marking counter, and fallback QR option.

ðŸš€ Why This Matters

Saves teaching time otherwise wasted on manual roll calls.

Prevents proxy attendance with layered checks.

Gives students clear insights into their progress.

Provides admins with institute-wide analytics for planning.

Works in low internet environments with offline sync.
